No late submissions beyond what is outlined in the Slip Day policy will be accepted. We strongly encourage you to plan to submit your work to Gradescope several hours before the stated deadline. This way, you will have ample time to reach out to staff for support if you encounter difficulties with submission. While course staff is happy to help guide you with submitting your assignment ahead of the deadline, we will not respond to last-minute requests for assistance (TAs need to sleep, after all!).\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "You will use what you've learned in class to create a binary classifier that can distinguish spam (junk, commercial, or bulk) emails from ham (regular non-spam) emails. In addition to providing some skeleton code to fill in, we will evaluate your work based on your model's accuracy and your written responses in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this project, you should feel comfortable with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature engineering with text data.\n",
    "- Using the `sklearn` library to process data and fit models.\n",
    "- Validating the performance of your model and minimizing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first part of the project focuses on initial analysis, feature engineering, and logistic regression. In the second part of this project (which will be released next week), you will build your own spam/ham classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Content Warning\n",
    "This is a **real-world** dataset —— the emails you are trying to classify are actual spam and legitimate emails. As a result, some of the spam emails may be in poor taste or be considered inappropriate. We think the benefit of working with realistic data outweighs these inappropriate emails but wanted to provide a warning at the beginning of the project so that you are aware.\n",

    "If you feel uncomfortable with this topic, **please contact your TA, the instructors, or reach out via the [Spring 2025 Additional Accomodations Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe23BU7DocByEPYt6YV00rOTn7K1AVj7Fqpw2eOgWG0Q5GtDw/viewform).**"

The spam message also includes a suspicious looking hyperlink with an IP address, whereas the ham email links a real website with trustworthy urls. "

If the $j$-th word in `words` is present at least once in the $i$-th email in `texts`, the output array should have a value of 1 at the position $(i, j)$. Otherwise, if the $j$-th word is not present in the $i$-th email, the value at $(i, j)$ should be 0.\n",

For example, the word 'bank' might appear in spam messages related to phishing, but it could also show up in legitimate emails from financial institutions like Bank of America. This overlap reduces the model’s ability to distinguish spam from ham based on these words alone, leading to lower predictive performance."

This makes it unrealistic for real-world use where detecting spam is important. While `my_model` has a low recall of around 11%, it still identifies some spam.
